## Features

This project is an example of a portfolio of myself. The data used is not real, and this is not an actual portfolio of myself. I have included sections called: About Me, Work, and Contact me.

About Me is a section that shows a brief paragraph about myself (fake) and a proessional headshot of myself (also fake)

Work is a section that has a list of projects that I have created, so that potential hiring managers can see the work that I have done. Once you click on one of the work sections, it will take you to that project. I have some of them going to the same project, because I have not created that many projects yet!

Contact Me has some fake contact information for me. 

I have also added media queries, so that when the window is smaller, the features adjust accordingly!
